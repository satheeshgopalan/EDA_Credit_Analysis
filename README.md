When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

When a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by the client/company):

Approved: The Company has approved loan Application
Cancelled: The client cancelled the application sometime during approval. Either the client changed her/his mind about the loan or in some cases due to a higher risk of the client he received worse pricing which he did not want.
Refused: The company had rejected the loan (because the client does not meet their requirements etc.).
Unused offer:  Loan has been cancelled by the client but on different stages of the process.
